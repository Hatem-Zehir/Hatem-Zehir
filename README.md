Hi, I’m @Hatem-Zehir, I have a passion for pattern recognition and machine learning. In the course of my engineering education, I focused on electronics and later on instrumentation. Very recently, I started as a PhD student on Biometric Security.

I master several programming languages (Python, MicroPython, C/C++, Assembly and VHDL) and microcontrollers (PIC, AVR, Arduino, ESP32, STM32).

**Programming languages:**

Hello, my name is @Hatem-Zehir, and I'm excited to share my passion for pattern recognition and deep learning with you. With a strong background in engineering, my focus has been on electronics and electrical engineering, and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Biometric Security.

As someone with a love for programming, I'm proficient in various languages, including Python, MicroPython, C/C++, Assembly, and VHDL. In addition, I have expertise in the utilization of microcontrollers such as PIC, AVR, Arduino, ESP32, and STM32, which are commonly used in embedded systems.

I believe that pattern recognition and deep learning have the potential to revolutionize many industries, from healthcare to finance to transportation. As a PhD candidate in Biometric Security, I'm particularly interested in exploring how machine learning can help improve security systems that rely on biometric data.
